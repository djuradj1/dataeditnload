    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size:15px;font-weight:500;line-height:32px;margin 0 0 24px;">A web developer from Montenegro. I am very passionate about technology and above all
programming. From the first time that i got in contact with programming i was amazed , since i am
more practical type of person, that i could make machine do something for which i gave command for.
It was for me like building a tree-house , and i loved computers from first moment and it got place in
my life pretty early.
I started learning programming in first year of high school, started learning from C to Java. After
school i did research and their i learned how to start making a websites. After High school i knew i
would like to improve my skills so i got in Faculty of Information Technology . My skills there improved
a lot and i got to learn more advanced stuff about HTML , CSS , Javascript ,CMS likes Joomla and
Wordpress. We had series of projects to do on our own. I always love doing projects like these so i
helped my friends as well.
While i was on collage i did few jobs as web developer , first i did a first website for company that i
worked in and it was about recycling toner , service printers and printing. After that i was invited to
work on big project nightclub Trocadero which only worked through summer and for new year, for
this project we did everything from scratch . Since i worked on other jobs for the most part of my
student days , now i would like to start my carrear as programmer .</p>
